# month_picker_dialog_2
[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/month_picker_dialog_2.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/month_picker_dialog_2)

Internationalized material style dialog for picking a single month from an infinite list of years.
This package makes use of the intl package and flutter's i18n abilities to provide labels in all languages known to flutter.

This package is a fork of the original month_picker_dialog from https://github.com/hmkrivoj/month_picker_dialog with some updates and fixes.

I`ll mantain this package until he starts developing again on the original one.
